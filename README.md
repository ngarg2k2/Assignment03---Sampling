Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model.

One way to select the random subset of the training data is through systematic sampling. Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling where every kth element in a population is selected for inclusion in the sample, where k is a predetermined interval.

Overall, using systematic sampling in Random Forest can help to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model by creating diverse subsets of the training data for each decision tree.
